<H1>Moodler</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
Moodler is a software modular synthesiser for MacOSX.
It consists of two parts:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>A server. This generates audio signals that are played though the default audio device.</LI>
<LI>A client. This sends commands to the server.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Audio is synthesised by modules that are connected using patch cables from the outputs of one modules to the inputs of another module.
</P>
<FIGURE>
<IMG SRC="intro1.png" ALT="Example of some modules with connections">
<FIGCAPTION>Figure 1. Some modules with connections</FIGCAPTION>
</FIGURE>
<P>
In Figure 1 we have three modules visible.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>On the left an "xor" module,</LI>
<LI>in the middle a "bass drum" module,</LI>
<LI>and on the right a "voltage comtrolled amplifier" module.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
We also have blue and orange wires connecting these modules.
</P>
<UL>
<LI>The blue wires carry control information.
For example the wire from the "xor" module to the "bass drum" module is blue.
It carries the signal saying when the drum should be triggered.</LI>
<LI>On the other hand, the output from the drum is attached to an orange cable.
This is because it corresponds to an audio signal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Note that in Moodler all signals are sampled at the same rate (typically 48kHz).
Some Moodler modules input and output integers and those cables have been coloured green.
</P>

<P>
The inputs to a module look like grey circles with a centre that indicates the type of the input.
The outputs from a module look like black circles with a similar centre indicating type.
</P>

<P>
You can connect a cable by dragging from an output to an input.
The cable will be coloured according to the colour of the output.
</P>

<P>
You can drag a cable from its end (in an input) if you wish to plug it in somewhere else.
Or if you release a dragged cable away from any input it will just vanish.
You can drag multiple cables to a single input.
Only the last will be active with the previous cables being coloured gray.
The previous cable will become active again should you delete a later cable.
When I fix the bug, the 'c' key will rotate through the cables attached to an input.
This allows you to try a bunch of different configurations in turn.
</P>

<P>
When you start the moodler UI you'll see two modules like those in Figure 2
</P>
<FIGURE>
<IMG SRC="intro2.png" ALT="Example of some modules with connections">
<FIGCAPTION>Figure 2. The modules present when the Moodler UI starts</FIGCAPTION>
</FIGURE>
<P>
The module on the left corresponds to MIDI input.
That requires a separate bridge application which will be described later.
The module on the right is the output module.
You'll need to connect an audio signal to it to hear anything.
</P>

<P>
Before running moodler you'll need to build it.
Currently, in <code>Moodler/MoodlerLib</code> you'll need to
<div class="codebox">
<code>
cabal install
</code>
</div>
and in <code>Moodler/Moodler</code>
<div class="codebox">
<code>
cabal build
<br>
make
</code>
</div>
<P>
The installation of <code>Moodler</code> needs to be global until
<A HREF="http://hub.darcs.net/jcpetruzza/hint/issue/5">hint issue #5</A>
is resolved.
The <code>make</code> will go away eventually.
</P>

<P>
To run Moodler go into <code>Moodler/Moodler</code> in two terminals.
In one run the server with
</p>
<div class="codebox">
<code>
cabal run moodler
</code>
</div>
<P>
and in the other run the GUI with
</P>
<div class="codebox">
<code>
cabal run ui
</code>
</div>

<P>
For a minimal example we'll listen to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO).
We'll run a script to build a VCO.
The scripts are in <code>Moodler/Moodler/scripts</code> and we want the one
called <code>vco</code>.
Move the cursor to the centre of the UI window and hit <code>alt-r</code>.
Now type in the script name <code>vco</code> and hit enter.
You should end up with a view like in Figure 3.
</P>
<FIGURE>
<IMG SRC="intro3.png" ALT="A VCO ready to be connected to output">
<FIGCAPTION>Figure 3. A VCO ready to be connected to output</FIGCAPTION>
</FIGURE>
<P>
Now drag from bottom right output of the VCO panel to the
input on the right.
You should hear a middle C played with a saw wave.
Turn the volume up if you hear nothing.
You should see some confirmatory output from the window running the
<code>moodler</code> process.
If you don't then something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
Now you can start experimenting. Trying connecting different outputs from
the VCO to the output. Try dragging the "Tune" knob.
If you select the square wave output (the top right of the four bottom
outputs) then try dragging the "PWM" knob.
</P>
<P>
You can drag on any component to move it around.
If you drag an input that has no cables leading to it you'll find you can
separate it from the panel where it lives.
In fact, you can use <code>alt-drag</code> to move any component around.
You can build your own modules by moving components around.
More of that later.
</P>

<H2>Key commands</H2>
<P>
The Moodler UI has a number of built-in key commands.
Apart from those, any script in <code>Moodler/Moodler/scripts</code>
may be bound to a (possibly modified) key.
</P>

<P>
Here are some built-in commands:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
<B>alt-s</B> Save entire patch, i.e. everything currently on screen.
When prompted for a name the final result is constructed by adding the extension
<code>.hs</code> and saving in <code>Moodler/Moodler/saves</code>.
The save format is in fact a Haskell script.
</P>
<P>
Saving with the empty patch name uses the current project patch name.
</P>
<P>
Note: If you save a patch with thousands of components and cables it can take a few
seconds to reload because it needs to be compiled.
At a future date I may implement an interpreter for the tiny subset of Haskell used
in saves.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<B>alt-l</B> Load an entire patch.
See <B>alt-s</B> for a description of how the file name is formed.
As a side effect it also sets the current project patch name.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<B>alt-r</B> Run a script.
The file name is constructed similarly to <B>alt-s</B> except that the
script comes from <code>Moodler/Moodler/scripts/</code>.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<B>alt-w</B> Write a script.
Saves a script corresponding to the currently selected components.
The script will recreates any dependencies needed, for example the contents
of planes linked to by proxies. (I haven't written plane/proxy docs yet.)
</P>

<LI>
<P>
<B>alt-z</B> Undo last command. I need to sprinkle more checkpoints through the
code to make this behave better.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<B>shift-alt-Z</B> Redo the last thing undone.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<B>"</B> Toggle <code>showhidden</code> mode.
See <a href="#hide">hide/unhide</a>.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Here are some commands from the default <code>moodlerrc</code>:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>delete</B> Delete the currently selected component.
If it's a container or proxy then the corresponding contents are also
deleted.
Note that nothing is ever really deleted on the server side but from
the user's perspective this is hard to observe so don't worry about it.
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<a name="hide"></a>
<B>alt-h</B> Hide currently selected components.
They still exist, they're simply not rendered.
Useful when you want to build a module without making its internal parts visible.
Hidden objects can be viewed in <code>showhidden</code> mode.
</P>
</LI>

<LI>
<P>
<B>shift-alt-H</B> Unhide currently selected components.
Hidden objects can be selected for unhiding when in <code>showhidden</code> mode.
</P>
</LI>
</UL>

<H2>Components</H2>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Inputs</B>

<LI>
<B>Outputs</B>

</UL>

<H2>Modules</H2>
<P>
Modules are built from primitives.
Examples of primitives are sine wave oscillators or addition operations.
The primitives are defined by the <code>.spec</code> files in
<code>Moodler/Moodler/modules</code>.
When <code>moodler</code> is launched it automatically generates a module
for each primitive in <code>scripts/</code>.
These are named after the primitive with an underscore prepended.
Other modules in <code>scripts/</code> were constructed non-automatically,
sometimes by writing Haskell code, sometimes by using <B>alt-w</B>.
</P>

<P>
Here are some modules:
</P>
<UL>

<!-- VCO MODULE -->
<LI>
<B>VCO</B>
<FIGURE>
<IMG SRC="vco.png" ALT="Voltage controlled oscillator">
<FIGCAPTION>Voltage controlled oscillator</FIGCAPTION>
</FIGURE>
<P>
The VCO module generates band-limited waveforms. It supports four types of
output:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<B>Sine wave</B>
Varies from -1 to 1.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Square wave</B>
<P>
This is the band-limited form of a square wave varying from -1 to 1.
This means it actually overshoots -1 and 1 slightly.
This is correct behaviour.
(See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon">Gibbs phenomenon</a>.)
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Triangle wave</B>
<P>
This is a band-limited triangle wave varying from 0 to 1.
</P>
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Saw wave</B>
<P>
This is a band-limited saw wave varying from -1 to 1.
</P>
</OL>
<P>
The input controls are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Tune</B>
Sets frequency of output.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>CV</B>
Also sets frequency of output.
This input is added to the value set by the "Tune" knob.
<LI>
<B>PWM</B>
For square waves this sets the width of the pulse relative to the oscillation
period.
</LI>
<LI>
<B>Sync</B>
Resets the phase of the output each time this input goes over zero.
A reasonable attempt has been made to ensure this reset operation is
band-limited for all four waveforms.
